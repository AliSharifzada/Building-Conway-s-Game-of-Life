# Building-Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a zero-player game requiring only an initial state and no further input. In its original setting, the game takes place on an infinite grid of square cells, each in one of two possible states: live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent cells).
